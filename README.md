# MarkMyRun
> [Kinvey](http://www.kinvey.com) hackathon app.

## Summary
The app retrieves Points of Interest based on the usersâ€™ current location, or the location entered. After, the user can pick any number of locations it wants to visit during a run. The app will then propose a running route. The purpose of this app is to combine the best of traveling and running.

## Installation
After cloning the repository:

  * Set-up your [Kinvey backend](https://console.kinvey.com).
  * Obtain a [Google Places API Key](https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/), and configure the location addon in your backend.
  * In your backend, create a `locations` collection and import `assets/locations.json`. Set the collection permissions to *Read Only*.
  * In your backend, create an `images` collection. Set the collection permissions to *Private*.
  * In your backend, add an `image` custom endpoint. Paste the code from `assets/custom-endpoint.js`. Set the `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` constant to your Google Places API Key, obtained in step 2.

Your backend is now set-up. To run your app:

  * Replace `Your App Key` and `Your App Secret` with your application credentials (`public/index.html`).
  * Run `node index` to start your app.
  * Open `http://localhost:3000/index.html`.
